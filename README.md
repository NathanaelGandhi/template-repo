### Updating from the Template Repository

Fetch the latest changes from the `release` branch of the _remote template repository_, and then merge those changes into your current branch, allowing for unrelated histories.

```sh
git fetch https://github.com/NathanaelGandhi/template-repo release \
  && git merge FETCH_HEAD --allow-unrelated-histories
```

_If there are merge conflicts, resolve them, `git add` the changes, and continue the merge with `git commit`._
